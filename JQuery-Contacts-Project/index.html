    Project Description: This project is a contact manager for managing personal and professional contacts.
    It currently supports the following capabilities.
    1) At startup, 3 contacts will be added for demo purposes if no contacts have been entered into storage yet.
    2) New contacts can be created and the form is validated to ensure that first and last name are entered and 
    either a phone number of email address is entered.
    3) Errors are styled and written into the span elements where applicable if an error is detected, and
       contacts aren't stored until validated.
    4) Contacts can be deleted, and will be removed from both local web storage and the DOM
    5) JQuery button and accordion controls are used in this project.
    6) The form is not shown until the Create Contact button is pressed which slides down the form.
    7) when a contact is entered successfully, it is added to the DOM, saved into web storage, and
       the contact form is hidden.
    8) Some limited validation of local storage is implemented at startup.  Since the unique id used as a 
       key is a number, only items with a numeric key are parsed.  Exception handling is used to skip
       any item in storage that cannot be parsed into a Contact object.
    9) A regex was used to validate the phone number.

    Limitations:
    1) An edit capability was not implemented due to time constraints, but the ultimate goal as I keep
       learning and refining is to load an existing contact into the form, slide down the form, and 
       and then update an existing contact if the information is valid.
    2) Obviously a database would have been a better choice for contacts, but for the limited time to 
       execute the project for the class an SQL database was not possible.  I was given an option to
       experiment with web storage or JQUERY plugins.
    3) Email and phone validation is limited.  The HTML5 auto validation didn't work at all for some 
       reason.  Using a regex for the phone number added some complexity and demonstrated the ability
       to research the concept.  A similar regex for email addresses could be used in the future or
       the HTML5 validation needs to be researched further.
